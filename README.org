Remove DOM nodes you are not interested in on some websites.

** Overview

When using the amazing emacs web browser, eww, we have the opportunity
to use `(eww-readable)` that will try to find the main "readable" part
of the website.  Most of the time, it works perfectly and is
amazing. But sometimes, even the most readable part contain some
content you are not really interested in and that adds a lot of noise.

This package allow you to define a list of DOM nodes you want to get rid of.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq eww-cleaner-rules-alist '(("\\**stackoverflow" .
								   ("#left-sidebar"
									"#sidebar"
									"#footer"
									".s-topbar--container"
									".post-taglist"
									".answers-subheader"
									".js-post-menu"
									".votecell"
									))))

#+END_SRC
